## What is web scraping and why is it useful?     

* Say you want to download some data off a website to do some analysis: 

\centerline{\includegraphics[scale = 0.15]{fig1.png}}

* You could manually copy and paste the data into a spreadsheet, but it would take a long time. 

* Web scraping is a faster alternative to this

## What is web scraping and why is it useful?     

* Web scraping is basically automating the collection/download of unstructured data from online sources into a format you can use, e.g., plain text, csv, JSON, etc   

* You can web scrape in lots of languages (e.g., python, java, and _R_!)

Some popular approaches to web scraping: 

1. Text pattern matching with regular expressions

2. Using an API

3. Parsing a website (what we'll do)

* I'll go through a simple parsing example
* If you're using an API or something more complex, you may need more technical skills/tools than rvest

## Scraping in rvest 
* Knowing some basics of HTML and CSS is helpful (but not required for the basics) 

* You can use the SelectorGadget chrome extension to find the necessary tags

The rvest package was inspired by 'Beautiful Soup' in python; created by Hadley Wickham (of course)
