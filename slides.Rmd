## What is web scraping and why is it useful?     

Say you want to download the Olympics data to do some analysis: 

\includegraphics[scale = 0.2]{fig1.png}

You could manually copy and paste the data into a spreadsheet, but it would take a long time. 

## What is web scraping and why is it useful?     

Web scraping is basically automating the collection/download of unstructured data from online sources into a format you can use, e.g., plain text, csv, JSON, etc   

You can web scrape in almost any language (e.g., python, java, and *R*!)

Some popular approaches to web scraping: 
1. Human copy and paste (no)
2. Text pattern matching with regular expressions
3. Using an API
4. DOM parsing a website
